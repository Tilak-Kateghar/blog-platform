**Examples**:
```javascript
// Copilot-generated blog creation endpoint
router.post('/', [auth, blogValidation], async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const blog = new Blog({
      ...req.body,
      author: req.user._id
    });
    await blog.save();
    res.status(201).json(blog);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
